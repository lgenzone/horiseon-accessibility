# Refactor Horiseon Webpage for Accessibility

## Descritption 


The Horiseon website has been refactored to ensure that the codebase is compliant with accessibility requirements. This is critical because it ensures that individuals with disabilities may access all of a website's contents using assistive technology such as screen readers, video captions, and braille keyboards. Web accessibility not only broadens inclusion, but it is also advantageous for business because accessible websites perform better in search engines such as Google. Furthermore, it supports businesses in avoiding potential legal action as a result of denying people with disabilitiesÂ access to their websites. This project has taught me the importance of web accessibility as well as the process of refactoring existing code.

## Usage 

The contents of the Horiseon webpage can be used by anyone, inlcuding people with disiabilities. Someone with visual impairments can understand the contents of this webpage by using assistive technologies such as screen readers. Each photo within the website is paired with descritptive alt text so that someone with visual impairments can use the website. 


## How to Contribute 

I am open to contributions. The requirements for contriubitions include finding ways to increase accessibility for this website. For example, if alt text is not descriptive enough and can be re-written to convey the image's meaning more accurately. 

Open the Chrome DevTools by clicking Command+Shift+I(macOS) or Control+Shift+I(Windows) to view the codebase.
